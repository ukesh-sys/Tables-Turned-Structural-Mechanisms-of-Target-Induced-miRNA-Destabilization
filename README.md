**_Tables Turned: Structural Mechanisms of Target-Induced miRNA Destabilization_**

## ðŸ“„ Summary

This study explores the non-canonical regulatory process where microRNAs (miRNAs) are destabilized upon binding specific target RNAs, rather than performing their usual function of silencing targets. Through structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal how specific target interactions contribute to miRNA decay by affecting AGO2-RISC complex stability.
